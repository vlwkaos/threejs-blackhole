# stellar color change
"Relativistically moving objects are beamed due to a variety of physical effects. **Light aberration** causes most of the photons to be emitted along the object's direction of motion. The **Doppler effect** changes the energy of the photons by red- or blueshifting them. Finally, time intervals as measured by clocks moving alongside the emitting object are different from those measured by an observer on Earth due to **time dilation** and photon arrival time effects. How all of these effects modify the brightness, or apparent luminosity, of a moving object is determined by the equation describing the relativistic Doppler effect (which is why relativistic beaming is also known as Doppler beaming)"

beaming - luminosity  
doppler - wavelength change  

blueshift from observer movement  
redshift from stellar movement  

the thing is, we don't know any information from static background texture, 
so applying doppler effect does not make any sense.
